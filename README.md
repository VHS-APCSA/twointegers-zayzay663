# TwoIntegers
Problems 2.15, 2.16, 2.25, 2.26
Create a class with two instance variables of type int.
Include two constructors (default and one with two parameters) and get/set methods for both of them.

Write separate methods for each problem.
For problem 2.15 write a method named arithmetic() and use the two instance variables
to calculate the values of sum, product, difference and quotient.
The method should return a String that displays the results.
Something like "5 + 3 = 8, 5 * 3 = 15, 5 / 3 = 1, 5 % 3 = 2" with 5 and 3 replaced with your actual numbers.
For problem 2.16 write a method named larger() that returns the larger integer. 
If they're equal than it doesn't matter which one you return.
For problem 2.25 write a method called isEven() that returns a boolean if the sum of the 
two integers is even and false if the sum is odd.
For problem 2.26 return a boolean that is true if the first int is a multiple of the 
second int and false otherwise.

You should print the results of each method in the runner.
The runner should use a Scanner to take user input for two numbers
and then use those two numbers to instantiate the class.
