# TwoIntegers
Problems 2.15, 2.16, 2.25, 2.26
Create a class with two instance variables of type int.
Include two constructors and get/set methods for both of them.

Write separate methods for each problem.
So for problem 2.15 write a method named arithmetic() and use the two instance variables
to calculate the values of sum, product, difference and quotient.
Every method should return a value, not print it.
For problem 2.15 return a String since you can't return multiple numerical values.
For problem 2.16 return the larger integer or NaN (not a number) if they're equal.
For problem 2.25 return a boolean that is true if even and false if odd.
For problem 2.26 return a boolean that is true if they are multiples and false otherwise.
You should print the results in the runner.
The runner should use a Scanner to take user input for two numbers
and then use those two numbers to instantiate the class.
